Project Overview

This project analyzes the cost of living in Armenia using diverse datasets covering housing, rentals, food prices, salaries, and transportation. The aim is to understand affordability trends and challenges faced by residents—particularly young adults seeking financial independence.

The analysis uses R for data cleaning, processing, and visualization, producing static plots to highlight key patterns and insights.
